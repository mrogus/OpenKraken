"""Host-side LED effect engine for Kraken-Redux.

This module is pure Python (no Qt, no I/O) and computes per-LED RGB frames for
the NZXT Kraken 2024 Elite RGB.  The device's *hardware* effect/animation modes
are rejected by its firmware (see ``PROTOCOL.md`` §7), so every effect -- even a
plain solid colour -- is realised as a full per-LED "Direct" frame streamed from
the host (``PROTOCOL.md`` §4/§5).

Because the device only reliably accepts Direct frames at roughly **1 frame per
second** (``PROTOCOL.md`` §5, OpenRGB #4828), the animated modes here are
designed to look acceptable when *sampled at 1 Hz*: slow sinusoidal breathing,
gentle cross-fades and a slow hue rotation -- never fast flashes or hard steps
that would alias into stutter at one update per second.

Public surface
--------------
* :class:`ModeSpec` -- static description of an effect (key, label, colour
  count bounds, whether it animates).
* :data:`MODES` -- the available effects keyed by ``ModeSpec.key``.
* :data:`SPEED_PERIODS` -- seconds-per-cycle for each named animation speed.
* :func:`frame` -- the one entry point: given a mode, the user's colour list, a
  host-side brightness (0-100), the channel's LED count, and elapsed seconds
  ``t``, return exactly ``led_count`` RGB triplets with brightness already
  applied.  Pure and deterministic; ``frame(...)`` repeats with the mode's
  period in ``t`` for animated modes.

Conventions
-----------
* Colours are ``(r, g, b)`` tuples, each component an ``int`` in ``0..255``.
  GRB-on-the-wire conversion and the actual HID framing live entirely in
  ``device.py`` -- nothing here knows about the wire format.
* Brightness is applied **host-side** (the device has no brightness command):
  every returned component is scaled by ``brightness / 100`` and clamped.
* ``t`` is "seconds since the mode was (re)applied"; the engine supplies a
  monotonic elapsed time.  ``t`` may be any non-negative float.
