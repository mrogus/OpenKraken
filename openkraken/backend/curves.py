"""Fan/pump duty curve maths for Kraken-Redux.

This module is pure Python (no Qt, no I/O) and provides:

* :data:`PROFILES` -- the built-in liquid-temperature presets used by the GUI
  and the control engine.
* :func:`interpolate` -- clamped piecewise-linear interpolation of a duty curve.
* :func:`validate_points` -- normalise a user-supplied point list into a clean,
  sorted, deduplicated, clamped curve with at least two points.
* :func:`software_failsafe` -- build a firmware-native liquid-temp profile that
  holds a software-computed duty but always ramps to 100 % before the loop can
  cook, so a crashed/killed app can never leave the cooler stuck low.
* :class:`DutySmoother` -- hysteresis that jumps duty up immediately for safety
  but ramps it down slowly, and suppresses tiny changes to avoid spamming the
  device with HID writes.

All curves are expressed as ``list[tuple[temp_c, duty_pct]]``; temperatures are
floats and duties are integer percentages.  The cooler firmware stores a 40-point
curve for liquid temperatures 20..59 C and runs it autonomously, so liquid-source
curves are written once and persist after the app exits.  CPU/GPU-source curves
are computed in software each tick and pushed as :func:`software_failsafe`
profiles.

    When a channel's curve is driven by CPU or GPU temperature, the app computes
    a duty each tick and writes a *flat* liquid-temperature profile so the
    firmware holds that duty.  But a flat profile alone is dangerous: if the app
    dies, the firmware would keep holding a possibly-low duty even as the loop
    heats up.  To guard against that we append a hard ramp to 100 % between 48
    and 54 C liquid temperature:

        ``[(20, d), (48, d), (54, 100)]``

    In normal operation the liquid stays well below 45 C, so the firmware always
    serves the computed duty ``d``; only a runaway loop (app dead, heat climbing)
    triggers the 48->54 C ramp to full speed.

    point list -- if a list is given, the duty at 20 C (its first/lowest point)
